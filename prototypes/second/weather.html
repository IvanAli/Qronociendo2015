                   <p>Querétaro is considered as one of the places most privileged because of its tempered weather, nonetheless, not everyday it´s warm, as maybe you were thinking! Due to all the damage our ozone layer have suffered, the weather in the entire world has suffered huge disturbance; and Querétaro is one of many of the cities, which have been affected for this phenomenon. Because of this reason, we shouldn't rely on the supposed warm weather and bring in our baggage all summer clothes! </p>

                   <p>Recommendations about what kind of clothes we should include in our luggage / wardrobe during our stay in Querétaro city:</p>
